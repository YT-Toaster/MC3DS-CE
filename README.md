# MC3DS-CE
- Minecraft 3DS Color Extractor (MC3DS-CE) extracts all ARGB Values found in Most Atlas files and MC-3DS Skins.
- Put in directory with files you want to extract and double click the executable file.
- This is based off of Cracko298's MC-3DS-Flip function but allows mass color extraction and other QoL additions.
